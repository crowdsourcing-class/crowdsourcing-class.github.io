This assignment has two deliverables:

1. Answering [the Homework 2 questionnaire on Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}) about the company or project that you are researching. This is due before {{ page.deliverables[0].due_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }} on {{ page.deliverables[0].due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }}.  If you are working with a partner, only one of you needs to submit the questionnaire. **Please save your survey answers in a file on your own computer**, so that you can have a copy to use for your presentation.
2. A presentation, optionally a video, about the company. If you're not submitting a video, Google Slides (or equivalent slide deck) are required. Several of the best videos will be selected for in-class presentations.  Teams whose videos are selected will receive extra credit. This is due before {{ page.deliverables[1].due_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }}  on {{ page.deliverables[1].due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }}.  You can submit a link to your video/slides on [the Gradescope presentation form]({{page.submission_link}}).

This assignment can be done in pairs.

## Part 1: Researching a Company 

First, please [sign up for a company or project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VcP0zT3UATj97opOe3_DMHC_Dxe975Ub7k2FxXsA5Us/edit?usp=sharing).  Up to two teams can sign up for a company.  If two teams have already signed up for a company that you're interested in then please pick a different company.  If there’s a company that you’d like to research that isn’t on the list, you are welcome to ask the instructor or the TA to ask if it is OK.  Please post your request to Piazza.  

Next, please read the academic paper [Human Computation:
A Survey and Taxonomy of a Growing Field](http://crowdsourcing-class.org/readings/downloads/intro/QuinnAndBederson.pdf).  The paper introduces several dimensions that we'll use to categorize the companies that you'll be doing research -- dimensions like motivation, quality control, aggregation, and so on.  We will ask you to write a short summary of the paper.

You and your partner should research the company together, and then [fill in your answers about it in the Homework 2 questionnaire on Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}).  Your short answers to these questions on  {{ page.deliverables[0].due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }}.  Remember to save your survey answers on your own computer, so that you can have a copy to use when you do your video profile.

## Part 2: Creating a Video 


You will prepare a short presentation in the form a 5 to 7 minute video presentation about your company. Your presentation should address the following questions:

- Are there any controversies about the company?

Your presentation is due on {{ page.deliverables[1].due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }}. To turn in your video, please upload it to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). Give us the link to your presentation or video using [the Homework 2 presentation form]({{page.submission_link}}). Make sure that your video is publicly viewable or that you give us a password to view it on the web form.

Here are instructions on how to sign up for Vimeo:

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading" markdown="1">
#### Instructions for uploading your video to Vimeo
</div>
<div class="panel-body" markdown="1">
1. Go to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).
2. Create an account by clicking the enormous blue "JOIN" button. 
3. You will receive and email with a link to verify your account. You have to verify before you can upload videos.
4. Once you are signed in, click "Upload" at the top of the page.
5. Click the "Choose a Video to Upload" button and choose your video
6. Once it is uploading, you can change the privacy settings. If you are soon to be on the job market, be careful. You probably don't want potential employers to know how intelligently and elegantly you are able to analyze and present on the potential market value of technology companies, so maybe don't use your real name.
7. That's it! Fill in the title and tags and what-have-you in the survey to tell us where to find it.

#### FAQ
</div>
<div class="panel-body" markdown="1">
- **What is the difference between Users and Contributors?**

  Many of you seemed confused about what constitutes a user vs. a contributor. In many crowdsourcing companies, this line is blurry- or nonexistent! Many companies you looked at fit what can be thought of as a "data-mining" model (e.g. Yelp, Foursquare), in which the primary service being provided depends on using data and modeling observed patterns of behavior-- e.g. to target ads or to recommend products. In these cases, the users are the contributors-- everyone who participates provides data, and everyone uses everyone else's data. This is an awesome crowdsourcing model because it is (ideally) self-sustaining and self-incentivizing. The more a person contributes (by providing more data about themselves), the better product they receive (e.g. better recommendations). 

- **How does my company do Aggregation?**

  Many of the companies we look at fit into the "match-making" or "marketplace" model (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Etsy). This is a very common case in which the company is simply working to match supply with demand, where the suppliers (e.g. drivers, in the case of Uber) and the consumers (riders) are distributed all over, and may have trouble finding one another otherwise. Here, rating systems etc. are one piece of the platform that might require aggregating, but arguably the more interesting aggregation problem is how to match a supplier with a consumer. Is this through preference-based recommendation systems (as in the data-mining model discussed above), through location-based matching, through bidding/price? Making these matches is non-trival, but crucial to making the company function.

- **Does this update a previous service or business model, or is it completely new?**

  For this question, more than a third of you said "completely new." Try to think broadly when you are considering where these crowdsourcing companies fit into the economy as a whole. (Think Silicon Valley's favorite buzzword: "disruption.") Most of these services being provided are not completely new, but they are directly competing with a service that was traditionally supplied by a brick-and-mortar company in a more centralized manner. Uber competes with taxi companies, Airbnb with hotel chains, Coursera with higher education universities. This is part of what makes crowdsourcing so exciting!

- **Is getting venture capital funding is a business model?**

  No. Smart investors don't invest in a company who says their plan for generating revenue is to "get money from investors." When in doubt about the company's business plan, it is probably "ads". :-)

- **How to make a group submission on Gradescope?**

  One group member can submit answers just as you do in previous homeworks. Then at the submitted page where you could see all your answers and points distribution, there is an option on the top right for you to edit group member. You can add your partner there with his or her Gradescope Id inside this course. Both of you with share the same submission and get the same grading. The submission is required to be made by only one team member.

<div class="panel panel-danger" id="rubric">
<div class="panel-heading" markdown="1">
#### Grading Rubric
</div>
<div class="panel-body" markdown="1">

The written survey is worth approximately 10% of your overall grade in the course. Please answer the survey questions thoughtfully. 
Extra credit would worth approximately 5% of the overall grade in the course.
