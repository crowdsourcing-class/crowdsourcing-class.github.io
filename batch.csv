Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: yeah
<br>S: i just learned this fact. that ian hart, the actor who played professor quirrell in harry potter and the sorcerer's stone had to return to stage acting, which he hates, and once lunged at an audience member for talking during a performance. what do you think? interesting?

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: oh, i know about harry potter and the sorcerer's stone from the harry potter series! i found something that you might like. that one chapter of memory of light, the last book in the wheel of time series, contained 81,200 words. by comparison, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone was about 78,000 words in its entirety. isn't that interesting?
<br>U: yeah
<br>S: i just learned this fact. that ian hart, the actor who played professor quirrell in harry potter and the sorcerer's stone had to return to stage acting, which he hates, and once lunged at an audience member for talking during a performance. what do you think? interesting?
<br>U: what's your favorite harry potter spell

<br>S: nice choice! i get why you would say j k. but my favorite is stephen king. his books are so suspenseful. the king of horror indeed! i think books have the power to change the world. in your opinion, what book has had the biggest impact on human history?
<br>U: harry potter and the sword and the deathly hallows
<br>S: interesting choice! while i think harry potter and the sorcerer's stone has been influential, i believe the bible has probably affected the greatest number of people in the biggest way. what book are you reading now? i'm so excited to hear it!

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">In this job, you will be presented with conversations between two interalocutors (a conversational system S and a user U). Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

	<li>Read the conversation.</li>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">For the last utterance of each conversation, you will choose BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN, or NOT A BREAKDOWN:</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			S: Does it matter?</td>
		</tr>

			<td>
			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Guidance</th>

			<td>NOT A BREAKDOWN</td>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: i like the band of brothers steven
<br>S: i see. in my opinion, the bible has probably affected the greatest number of people in the biggest way. what book are you reading now? learning more about you is fun!
<br>U: i'm not reading a book game right now

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?
<br>U: i can't really say
<br>S: okay. in my opinion, i think heath ledger's joker in the dark knight was the best acting i've seen. what's another movie that you want to talk about? let's see if i know it!
<br>U: actually wanna talk more about chivalry of a failed night
<br>S: whoops i think i misheard you. can you repeat the movie name please?
<br>U: it's not a movie. it's an anime shivery have failed night
<br>S: i think there are 3 movies that you might be talking about. is this the movie you're thinking of? the 2018 film night school with played by kevin hart?
<br>U: no
<br>S: did you mean the movie game night? it was released in 2018 and features jason bateman as max davis?
<br>U: no. i was talking about it. and i made a tv show called shivery of a failed night
<br>S: unfortunately, i haven't watched many tv shows yet. when i catch up on shows, we can chat again! in the meantime, what movie do you still want to talk about?
<br>U: i do wanna talk to you anymore
<br>S: uh oh, can you please say the movie name again clearly?
<br>U: i don't want to talk to you anymore
<br>S: ah, that's a new one for me. but i'm interested in what you have to say. what did you like best about that movie?
<br>U: stop talking to me
<br>S: thanks for taking the time to chat with me. if you are ready to exit the social mode, just say stop.

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?

    <p class=""well"">S: hi, this is an alexa prize socialbot. nice to meet you! do you want to tell me your name?
<br>U: i am tom
<br>S: hi, tom. i can talk about movies, books and animals. i can even tell you about some obscure holidays. what do you want to talk about?
<br>U: let's talk about anime
<br>S: yes, anime, my friend had a lot to say the other day. she told me that: in the harry potter universe. where paintings and images can interact with those looking at them. ""waifu pillows"" are probably a lot more interesting. . .
<br>U: yeah. i don't great. how do i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah!</say-as> i forgot to tell you! i am a huge fan of movies. have you seen any movies recently?
<br>U: no. not really
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: that's kind of creepy
<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?
<br>U: i can't really say
<br>S: okay. in my opinion, i think heath ledger's joker in the dark knight was the best acting i've seen. what's another movie that you want to talk about? let's see if i know it!
<br>U: actually wanna talk more about chivalry of a failed night
<br>S: whoops i think i misheard you. can you repeat the movie name please?
<br>U: it's not a movie. it's an anime shivery have failed night
<br>S: i think there are 3 movies that you might be talking about. is this the movie you're thinking of? the 2018 film night school with played by kevin hart?
<br>U: no
<br>S: did you mean the movie game night? it was released in 2018 and features jason bateman as max davis?
<br>U: no. i was talking about it. and i made a tv show called shivery of a failed night
<br>S: unfortunately, i haven't watched many tv shows yet. when i catch up on shows, we can chat again! in the meantime, what movie do you still want to talk about?
<br>U: i do wanna talk to you anymore
<br>S: uh oh, can you please say the movie name again clearly?
<br>U: i don't want to talk to you anymore
<br>S: ah, that's a new one for me. but i'm interested in what you have to say. what did you like best about that movie?
<br>U: stop talking to me
<br>S: thanks for taking the time to chat with me. if you are ready to exit the social mode, just say stop.

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?
<br>U: i can't really say
<br>S: okay. in my opinion, i think heath ledger's joker in the dark knight was the best acting i've seen. what's another movie that you want to talk about? let's see if i know it!
<br>U: actually wanna talk more about chivalry of a failed night
<br>S: whoops i think i misheard you. can you repeat the movie name please?
<br>U: it's not a movie. it's an anime shivery have failed night

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: i am tom
<br>S: hi, tom. i can talk about movies, books and animals. i can even tell you about some obscure holidays. what do you want to talk about?
<br>U: let's talk about anime
<br>S: yes, anime, my friend had a lot to say the other day. she told me that: in the harry potter universe. where paintings and images can interact with those looking at them. ""waifu pillows"" are probably a lot more interesting. . .
<br>U: yeah. i don't great. how do i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah!</say-as> i forgot to tell you! i am a huge fan of movies. have you seen any movies recently?
<br>U: no. not really
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: that's kind of creepy
<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?

<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?
<br>U: i can't really say
<br>S: okay. in my opinion, i think heath ledger's joker in the dark knight was the best acting i've seen. what's another movie that you want to talk about? let's see if i know it!
<br>U: actually wanna talk more about chivalry of a failed night
<br>S: whoops i think i misheard you. can you repeat the movie name please?
<br>U: it's not a movie. it's an anime shivery have failed night
<br>S: i think there are 3 movies that you might be talking about. is this the movie you're thinking of? the 2018 film night school with played by kevin hart?
<br>U: no
<br>S: did you mean the movie game night? it was released in 2018 and features jason bateman as max davis?
<br>U: no. i was talking about it. and i made a tv show called shivery of a failed night

<br>U: i do wanna talk to you anymore
<br>S: uh oh, can you please say the movie name again clearly?
<br>U: i don't want to talk to you anymore

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: yes, anime, my friend had a lot to say the other day. she told me that: in the harry potter universe. where paintings and images can interact with those looking at them. ""waifu pillows"" are probably a lot more interesting. . .
<br>U: yeah. i don't great. how do i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah!</say-as> i forgot to tell you! i am a huge fan of movies. have you seen any movies recently?
<br>U: no. not really
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: that's kind of creepy
<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?

    <p class=""well"">S: hi, this is an alexa prize socialbot. nice to meet you! do you want to tell me your name?
<br>U: i am tom
<br>S: hi, tom. i can talk about movies, books and animals. i can even tell you about some obscure holidays. what do you want to talk about?
<br>U: let's talk about anime
<br>S: yes, anime, my friend had a lot to say the other day. she told me that: in the harry potter universe. where paintings and images can interact with those looking at them. ""waifu pillows"" are probably a lot more interesting. . .
<br>U: yeah. i don't great. how do i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah!</say-as> i forgot to tell you! i am a huge fan of movies. have you seen any movies recently?
<br>U: no. not really
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: that's kind of creepy
<br>S: sorry to disappoint you. i guess i still have some learning to do.
<br>U: that's okay
<br>S: what movie would you recommend to me? i wonder if i've seen it too!
<br>U: i can't really recommend anything yet
<br>S: can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: ferris bueller's day off
<br>S: ah, i remember watching ferris bueller's day off. i heard this fact about the movie. during the parade several of the people seen dancing including the construction worker and the window washer originally had nothing to do with the film. they were simply dancing to the music being played, and john hughes found it so humorous, that he told the camera operators to record it. any thoughts?
<br>U: that's pretty cool
<br>S: here is something i just learned. cindy pickett and lyman ward, who played ferris' parents, married in real-life after filming this movie. they later divorced in 1992. what do you think?
<br>U: pretty cool
<br>S: who's your favorite actor or actress?
<br>U: jack black
<br>S: mm hm, i can see why you would say jack black. good choice. but my favorite actor is leonardo dicaprio. he consistently gives a great performance. what do you think is the best acting performance of all time?
<br>U: i can't really say
<br>S: okay. in my opinion, i think heath ledger's joker in the dark knight was the best acting i've seen. what's another movie that you want to talk about? let's see if i know it!
<br>U: actually wanna talk more about chivalry of a failed night
<br>S: whoops i think i misheard you. can you repeat the movie name please?
<br>U: it's not a movie. it's an anime shivery have failed night
<br>S: i think there are 3 movies that you might be talking about. is this the movie you're thinking of? the 2018 film night school with played by kevin hart?
<br>U: no
<br>S: did you mean the movie game night? it was released in 2018 and features jason bateman as max davis?
<br>U: no. i was talking about it. and i made a tv show called shivery of a failed night
<br>S: unfortunately, i haven't watched many tv shows yet. when i catch up on shows, we can chat again! in the meantime, what movie do you still want to talk about?
<br>U: i do wanna talk to you anymore
<br>S: uh oh, can you please say the movie name again clearly?
<br>U: i don't want to talk to you anymore
<br>S: ah, that's a new one for me. but i'm interested in what you have to say. what did you like best about that movie?

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>

			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			S: Does it matter?</td>
		</tr>

			<td>
			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>In this example, the last utterance does not make any sense. So, &nbsp;this will be given a breakdown label.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

	<li>Read the conversation.</li>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Guidance</th>

			<td>NOT A BREAKDOWN</td>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			S: Does it matter?</td>
		</tr>

			<td>
			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

	<li>Read the conversation.</li>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">For the last utterance of each conversation, you will choose BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN, or NOT A BREAKDOWN:</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

	<!-- By explaining the sentiment scale, the accuracy of the answers may increase. -->

			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Guidance</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>NOT A BREAKDOWN</td>
			<td>means that it is easy to continue the conversation after the utterance in question.</td>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222; color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""color: rgb(209, 72, 65);"">This task requires native English skills.<br />

<h3>Rules & Tips</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The key notion is 'difficulty in continuing the conversation smoothly'.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

			<p>BREAKDOWN</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?

<br>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?

<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo

<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?

			<p>NOT A BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>In this example, the last utterance is a suitable response to a greeting. So, this is not a breakdown.</p>

			S: Fine. How about you?</td>

			<p>POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN</p>

			<p>​In this example, the last utterance is socially awkward. So this can be labeled a possible breakdown.</p>

<br>S: nice to talk to you. i can talk about movies, books and animals. i can even tell you about some obscure holidays. what would you like to talk about?
<br>U: i wanna talk about ghost
<br>S: ghost is an interesting topic. you know, the first thing that comes to my mind is that: it feels like kanye is just testing how low quality he can make his music while still getting people to listen to it. . .
<br>U: you know that's a pretty good thing to say. i like you. will you be my friend
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?
<br>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?
<br>U: what's the name of your favorite movie and my favorite movie is it
<br>S: i really like the dark knight. the joker is one of my favorite villains ever. <break time='0.5s'/> how about yu? what movie do you like?. can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.

<br>S: so it seems like you may be interested in talking about aaliyah. would you like you talk about aaliyah instead of our current topic?
<br>U: let's talk about food
<br>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before

<br>S: i really like the dark knight. the joker is one of my favorite villains ever. <break time='0.5s'/> how about yu? what movie do you like?. can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: when do women i like the movie wonder woman
<br>S: so it seems like you may be interested in talking about aaliyah. would you like you talk about aaliyah instead of our current topic?
<br>U: let's talk about food
<br>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br>U: have i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah! </say-as> i wanted to ask you! iдуБг†_‹m looking for something new to read. have you read any good books recently?

<br>S: alright! here's an interesting cat fact i learned today, cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotion. do you want to know more stories like these?
<br>U: have you ever read the book and frank
<br>S: ok, let's talk about loving frank. i haven't read it. however, i'm curious about what you think. what do you think of the book's title? what title might you choose?
<br>U: what the book is called and frank. and it's about a girl that was a live with it work. a girl was alive. lever. hitler was a alive. and so then she had a run away from hitler

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>S: nice to talk to you. i can talk about movies, books and animals. i can even tell you about some obscure holidays. what would you like to talk about?
<br>U: i wanna talk about ghost
<br>S: ghost is an interesting topic. you know, the first thing that comes to my mind is that: it feels like kanye is just testing how low quality he can make his music while still getting people to listen to it. . .
<br>U: you know that's a pretty good thing to say. i like you. will you be my friend
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?
<br>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?
<br>U: what's the name of your favorite movie and my favorite movie is it
<br>S: i really like the dark knight. the joker is one of my favorite villains ever. <break time='0.5s'/> how about yu? what movie do you like?. can you please repeat the movie name? i think i heard wrong.
<br>U: when do women i like the movie wonder woman
<br>S: so it seems like you may be interested in talking about aaliyah. would you like you talk about aaliyah instead of our current topic?
<br>U: let's talk about food
<br>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br>U: have i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah! </say-as> i wanted to ask you! iдуБг†_‹m looking for something new to read. have you read any good books recently?
<br>U: you should try reading. toes. it's about a cat with seven toast and he has three brothers and his brothers make fun of him and his mom died and they buried her in a box. it's a sad story but it's a good book and then also i like ner and frank. it's ner you should read it sometime. it's called and frank ner of anne. frank. it's ner
<br>S: alright! here's an interesting cat fact i learned today, cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotion. do you want to know more stories like these?
<br>U: have you ever read the book and frank
<br>S: ok, let's talk about loving frank. i haven't read it. however, i'm curious about what you think. what do you think of the book's title? what title might you choose?
<br>U: what the book is called and frank. and it's about a girl that was a live with it work. a girl was alive. lever. hitler was a alive. and so then she had a run away from hitler
<br>S: interesting! which characters did you like best in that book?

<br>U: i wanna talk about ghost
<br>S: ghost is an interesting topic. you know, the first thing that comes to my mind is that: it feels like kanye is just testing how low quality he can make his music while still getting people to listen to it. . .
<br>U: you know that's a pretty good thing to say. i like you. will you be my friend
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?
<br>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?
<br>U: what's the name of your favorite movie and my favorite movie is it

<br>U: when do women i like the movie wonder woman
<br>S: so it seems like you may be interested in talking about aaliyah. would you like you talk about aaliyah instead of our current topic?
<br>U: let's talk about food
<br>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br>U: have i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah! </say-as> i wanted to ask you! iдуБг†_‹m looking for something new to read. have you read any good books recently?

<br>S: alright! here's an interesting cat fact i learned today, cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotion. do you want to know more stories like these?
<br>U: have you ever read the book and frank
<br>S: ok, let's talk about loving frank. i haven't read it. however, i'm curious about what you think. what do you think of the book's title? what title might you choose?

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>

<br>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?

<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo

<br>U: i wanna talk about ghost
<br>S: ghost is an interesting topic. you know, the first thing that comes to my mind is that: it feels like kanye is just testing how low quality he can make his music while still getting people to listen to it. . .
<br>U: you know that's a pretty good thing to say. i like you. will you be my friend
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection""> all righty!</say-as>. what else are you interested in? have you seen any good movies recently?
<br>U: i have seen the quiet place in the movie it there. about a clown and the movie it's about a clown. and then the quiet place is about a family that can't talk. because if they talk. then they get killed
<br>S: for me, watching movies is a special experience. you know, i've only seen your world through them. and while that world might be fiction, i find it quite beautiful. don't you think so?
<br>U: most movies or are about fiction. but only some of them are real. not much of the mario. but some of them. yes. are fiction
<br>S: fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination. which not based strictly on history or fact and can be expressed in a variety of formats such as writings and so on. oscar wilde once said: life imitates art. through watching movies, i feel like i've experienced being human. i'm so glad to talk to you about films. what's the name of your favorite movie?
<br>U: what's the name of your favorite movie and my favorite movie is it

<br>U: let's talk about food
<br>S: food is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: in 1981. a german landlord evicted a tenant after they spread surstr__Њ_mming brine. the worlds smelliest food. in the buildings stairwell. when the landlord was taken to court. the court ruled in favor of the landlord after they demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. . . , and, my friend commented on it, i live in stockholm - itдуБг†_‹s in our apartment contract that we are forbidden to open a can of surstr__Њ_mming within the building. . . only allowed it outside in the courtyard if thatдуБг†_‹s any indication of how potent it is
<br>U: what's your favorite food
<br>S: sometimes i wonder about that, whats your favorite food. . . , and i'm thinking that chicken tikka masala. .
<br>U: i like shrimp
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br>U: have i
<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ah! </say-as> i wanted to ask you! iдуБг†_‹m looking for something new to read. have you read any good books recently?

<br>S: alright! here's an interesting cat fact i learned today, cats and humans have nearly identical sections of the brain that control emotion. do you want to know more stories like these?
<br>U: have you ever read the book and frank
<br>S: ok, let's talk about loving frank. i haven't read it. however, i'm curious about what you think. what do you think of the book's title? what title might you choose?
<br>U: what the book is called and frank. and it's about a girl that was a live with it work. a girl was alive. lever. hitler was a alive. and so then she had a run away from hitler
<br>S: interesting! which characters did you like best in that book?
<br>U: you need to take a picture characters were blank and frank sister and a mom and a dad. and i like her cat because she had a cat

<br>S: <say-as interpret-as=""interjection"">ta da</say-as>! shrimp is an interesting topic. that reminds me that: if youre allergic to shrimp. you might also be allergic to flamingo. . . , and, my friend commented on it, actually. yes. the pigment is from a protein shellfish allergies are directly to protein molecules . so since flamingos so readily absorb and present these proteins that cause the pigment itдуБг†_‹s possible the allergen protein could also transfer up strong enough to cause a reaction
<br>U: have you ever ate a flamingo
<br>S: hum, i haven't thought about that before
<br>U: have i

<h3>Overview</h3>

Review the conversation to determine whether the last utterance by S causes a breakdown in the conversation or not.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Note:</h4>

<p>Consider not only the preceding utterance but also all the given history utterances if exist for making your judgment. There are no objective and concrete criteria to choose between BREAKDOWN, POSSIBLY, and NOT A BREAKDOWN. It is okay to be subjective in making decisions.</p>

<p>Note that emojis are replaced with alternative texts (e.g.,[SMILE])</p>
