  when_was_the_company_started: Company was started in 2007-2008 in the Netherlands
  who_were_the_founders: Peter Weijmarshausen, Robert Schouwenburg and Marleen Vogelaar
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: It started as a spinoff from Royal Philips Electronics in the Netherlands in 2007.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Shapeways provides a 3D printing service in many materials and finishes. Anyone can upload a 3D model to the website and someone may order to print that object. Users can also sell those designs and find designers to collaborate with to create products. Shapeways will print those objects for a fee on top of the price they set. Recently they have partnered with businesses offering 3D scanning services in order to make 3D scanning technology accessible to their customers. They also offer tutorials and tools to help customers design 3D models.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model_or_is_it_completely_new:
  if_it_updates_something_what_does_it_replace: Shapeways is a public marketplace that manufacturers its own goods. They charge fees for printing a product offered on the marketplace or on an individual's design.<p>Shapeways replaces the traditional marketplace model by manufacturing the seller's items. When it was founded, there were no personal 3D printers in the market. Shapeways saw an opportunity to change the traditional business model of manufacturing and innovate by offering an online marketplace for 3D printed goods. Similar business models are those offered by custom T-shirt making companies, where designers upload their designs and people can buy them.<p>
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Meltwork<p>Sculpteo<p>i.materialise<p>Thingiverse<p>Ponoko<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: A Jewelry designer who uploads my models on Shapeways' marketplace. People can buy his/her designs in different printed materials and he/she can charge any price for a design. For each sale he/she makes his/her listed price minus the quoted print cost from Shapeways.<p>Designers and entrepreneurs design and sell products while anyone interested in non mass-manufactured products buy from the marketplace. These tend to be products that are not yet offered by any online retailer and solve a very specific issue for the user. <p>
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Designers or entrepreneurs who want to sell a few of their designs or create their own shop online. Shapeways helps them test those and check if there is demand for them.<p>
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Creators are incentivised by getting paid when others purchase their printed designs.<p>
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts__professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts__professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Shapeways generates revenue through production fees from items that they print.<p>
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The 3D printing process they use is very thorough. They use expensive and modern machines to print those objects and the people they hire ensure that the quality of the products is exceptional.<p>
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards:
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so_how_does_it_work: No, because Shapeways prints all of its products. No marketplace "shops" have rankings or a reputation system. One can sort through popular/featured stores and designs. Users can also comment on the product's page.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: The marketplace is sorted conveniently into categories such as Gadgets, Accessories, Jewlery etc and contributors set up shops which group their items in. As a user, you can browse those shops for goods from the same designer.<p>
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised_and_how_the_contributors_contribute_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end: (1) Designer uploads a 3D model to the website. (2) Random user is interested and buys the product (3) Shapeways prints the object in one of their factories (4) Shapeways ships the product to the buyer (5) Designer and Shapeways gets some money and the user all the fun!<p>
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_users: In 2015, the company had 500,000 "shapies", which are the contributors of 3D model designs.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_dollars: Since it's privately held, there is no data on revenues/profits. But the company has received $76.3 million in funding since it started in 2008.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If Shapeways were to scale up by a significant percentage it would have to expand its 3D printing facilities accordingly, as well as labor. It could potentially move printing to China or India where costs are lower.<p>The incentive scheme would still work, because it would mean that there would be more buyers and, therefore, more money for the sellers. Quality may decrease, but they could potentially offer different printing qualities.<p>
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: No. People are unnecessarily worried about 3D printed guns though. These guns are not precise at all and at most can shoot one bullet before breaking into many parts.<p>
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: You should definitely try it if you haven't yet!<p>

  what_date_did_you_choose_for_your_inclass_presentation: 11/17/2014
  what_company_are_you_profiling: Estimize
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: www.estimize.com (and other URLS from their website)<p>https://angel.co/estimize<p>https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/estimize#/entity
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Talked with founder / CEO, as well as various employees that work at the company<p> Submit estimates on their website, both for equities and macroeconomic indicators
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company: Estimize crowdsources equity earnings estimates and macroeconomic indicators to produce a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street's estimates in over 70% of occasions.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.estimize.com/users/analyst_494393
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_logo: http://com.estimize.public.s3.amazonaws.com/brand-assets/estimize_full-logo_color.png
  when_was_the_company_started: 2011
  who_were_the_founders: Leigh Drogen
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Leigh Drogen was previously an analyst at a quantitative hedge fund that used many strategies around earnings events. Every quarter, Leigh would see the same thing - companies would beat their earnings estimates given by Wall Street almost 100% of the time. Upon further inspection, he saw that Wall Street analysts are incentivized to low ball their estimates for companies due to the relationships that they have, and he saw the opportunity to make the estimates a more fair representation of what will truly happen. He quit his job at the hedge fund and started Estimize, with the drive to make estimates more democratic and transparent for everyone.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Estimize provides multiple services through earnings estimates. The first is the sheer raw data of estimates. Estimize collects estimates for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for nearly every US Exchange listed company. The raw data that the company collects comes from individuals who sign up for the company's website. These individuals can be professionals, students, independent investors, research analysts, etc. Then, Estimize generates a consensus, which is an average of every valid estimate, into one singular number. To sell the data, Estimize provides 3 spreadsheets- the first includes a list of every user on estimize along with their biographical data, the second includes every estimate that has been made on the website, and the third includes every release, or every earnings event that has occured, with both the estimize consensus for EPS and revenue, as well as the Wall Street estimates. <p>The second main service that Estimize provides is a stock screener. On this screener, individuals are able to screen US listed stocks for specific analytics in their earnings estimates. They are able to search for analytics such as % of the time Estimize is more accurate than the Wall Street consensus, or % of the time company beats Estimize consensus. This stock screener is unlike any other stock screener already available, because no other data sets exist like Estimize's, so it is novel. <p>
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something_what_does_it_replace: The previous model Estimize replaces is Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. These estimates typically come from 20-30 of the same research analysts at investment banks that make estimates on the companies time and time again. The Estimize data set draws from a broader representation of the population, by polling individuals who are both directly involved in financial markets and those who are not.<p>
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Ticker Tags<p>Stocktwits<p>However, these companies are only similar in that they are in the social finance sphere and crowdsource. No other company crowdsources earnings estimates, and it is a 100% unique concept.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Hedge funds that use quantitative strategies to trade will use the Estimize data. The Estimize data contains more accurate representations of what the market is expecting, so hedge funds will be able to make more accurate trades and generate larger alpha than they will with data from Thomson Reuters. Whether this results in them engaging in post-earnings trading strategies, pre-earnings strategies, or even holding through earnings announcements, the data has been academically proven to produce alpha and create returns.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The people who contribute are any individuals who sign up for the website to submit estimates. These people can range from hedge fund managers, to research analysts at investments, to students, to academics, to even professionals that are not in the field in finance. Anyone is eligible to sign up and contribute, and the biographies of those who contribute is very diverse.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The data set is blind to any individual who does not contribute. That is, if you do not contribute, you will not be able to see the estimates for any given stock. The company also incentivizes individuals to contribute by giving an assessment of the individual's history, and providing a track record for individual analysts to show to employers, clients, etc. Finally, there is a leagues feature (think Fantasy football, except for estimates), in which individuals are able to win prizes (super bowl tickets, gift cards, etc.) if they are the most accurate in the league.<p>Despite all of these incentives, when polled, the contributors cited wanting to build a more accurate data set as the #1 reason why they contribute. Most of the contributors want to contribute to a more transparent data set that Thomson Reuters does not provide.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts__professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts__professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company generates revenue in multiple ways - namely, they generate revenue by selling their data to quantitative hedge fund.<p>Other ways the company generates revenue is through the screener, which allows individuals to manage lists of stocks with given characteristics around earnings (see previous answer), and this screener is sold for a monthly fee depending on the assets the individual or company manages.<p>Finally, Estimize generates revenue through its leagues feature - companies pay Estimize both in cash as well as through prizes to sponsor a league and have their name appear on the page.
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Estimize runs many algorithms on the front end of its website in order to ensure the quality of its data. The first is a general algorithm that compares any individual's estimate to the Estimize consensus for that estimate. If any person's estimate is plus or minus 2 standard deviations from the estimate, that person's estimate will automatically be flagged and removed from the system.<p>Secondly, Estimize runs many more complex algorithms to further ensure the quality of its data. Estimize runs algorithms that detect various details, such as the amount of time spent on the website before making the estimate, how accurate the user has been on the past, what other parts of Estimize has the user recently clicked to before submitting this estimate, did the user only change the default estimate by a little before submitting, etc. All of this results in a simple boolean, true or false, as to whether the estimate was flagged. An analysis of their data shows that nearly 1 in 10,000 estimates needs to be flagged, so users typically do not submit false estimates. Of those that are reported, nearly 999/1000 are due to mechanical errors by humans - someone submits $15 instead of $1.50 for earnings per share. Barely any estimates are truly submitted with the intent of gaming the system.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: N/A
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so_how_does_it_work: Users are rated on the accuracy of their estimate for every estimate that they submit. They get a certain amount of either positive or negative points, for EPS and revenue, for every submission. This, along with the number of estimates the user has submitted, are turned into a Confidence level 1-10, that is displayed on the user's profile to show how accurate they are. As you make more estimates that are accurate, your confidence level goes up. If your estimates are consistently inaccurate, then your confidence level will go down.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: The users contributions are aggregated through the backend of the website. Users submit estimates through the front end, and an algorithm runs on the backend to calculate the simple average of every individual's estimate. Recently (~ 2 weeks ago), the company released a new consensus, called the Estimize select consensus. This consensus weights individuals' estimates based off of how accurate they have been in the past. This is an extra fee on top of the base data, and it has been shown to be more accurate than Wall Street 80% of the time (as opposed to the usual 70% for Estimize). <p>Graphs display individuals' estimates on the website, along with a list that shows every estimate made.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised_and_how_the_contributors_contribute_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end: 1) The service is not advertised for directly. Advertisements occur through media appearances by company executives, and through word of mouth in the financial industry<p>2) Users contribute (as said above) through the front end of the website, or through software that directly hooks to their financial terminal (although this is about 2% of users).<p>3) Users get to see what the Estimize consensus is for any given stock, along with being able to build a track record for their history. They are also able to win prizes or money.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_users: 17,063
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_dollars: Currently revenue is around $1 million per year, but growing (only a guess given how many clients)
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Very well. The incentive scheme doesn't change much, given that people are still able to view the consensus estimates, and the top analysts still receive prizes. In fact, the data has shown to be even more accurate the more people that create estimates (supported by the Wisdom of the Crowds), so if the company were to scale up 10 or 100 times, it would be extremely beneficial. Right now the company is currently trying to figure out digital marketing strategies in order to grow its user base.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: There have been no controversies, but some hedge fund managers have doubted the accuracy of the estimize data. They only doubt the accuracy until they perform the analysis on the data themselves, and then they find that their biases go away. Many are just very skeptical about how a new company like Estimize can change the status quo that has been around for decades.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: It may be a little difficult to understand what the company does if you do not have a finance background, so I am happy to meet to talk about what Estimize does and how the company functions.
