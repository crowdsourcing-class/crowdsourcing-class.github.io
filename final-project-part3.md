Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 3</span> 
=============================================================

The final project presentations will happen during the final exam slot on {{ page.final_exam_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} at {{ page.final_exam_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }} in {{page.final_exam_location}}.  By that time, your system will need to be fully operational, and you'll have to have collected enough data to do an interesting analysis.  We recommend looking over [the questions on the final questionnaire](final-project-part5.html#survey), so that you get a sense of what is expected of the final project. You should pay attention to what sorts of analyses you can do for your final project. 

For your final project, you can collect data by employing a real crowd, or by having your classmates simulate the crowd.  For this part of the project, you will finish a working version of your system, so that your classmates can help you as a simulated crowd, with the goals of debugging your system before you turn the real crowd loose on it, and/or creating some data that you can use to analyze for your final project.

Your classmates will make contributions before the last day of classes, and will get credit toward their participation grade for their contributions.

### What you should do to prepare

* Get a working prototype ready.
* Be sure that it is capable of collecting data from the crowd.
* Write a step-by-step README that walks your classmates through how to use your system, including all details about how to access it and what you want them to do. If you are using a crowdsourcing platform to collect your crowd contributions, then you should set up your project to be running on the Mechanical Turk Worker Sandbox.  
* Put together a short video tutorial that shows *you* using the system for a new member of the crowd (like one of your classmates) and explains to them how you would like them to make contributions to your project.
* Think about what sort of analysis you want to do.  
	- Do you want to compare your system against an existing non-crowdsourcing method?  
	- Do you want to analyze how accurate the crowd is at making predictions?
	- Do you want to test how well your method could scale in terms of time/money?
* Make sure that your capturing the appropriate information so that you can do your analysis.
